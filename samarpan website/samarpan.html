	 	  		As we begin our quest for health and healing, I’d like to invite you to ask yourself the following question: “What is it that brought me to yoga and keeps me here—keeps me involved, seeking, studying, and doing my practice?” Most people come to yoga because of some kind of discomfort, ailment, or pain. Often it’s a physical ailment, such as arthritis or a stiff lower back. It could be that our muscles are tight due to stress or a sedentary lifestyle and we want to increase our range of motion and become more flexible. Or it could be pain of a deeper nature—chronic stress, past trauma, a failed relationship, or the realization of the undeniable fact that we are aging. I vividly remember one seminar participant, a middle-aged gentleman, stating that he came to his first yoga class because his wife “dragged me by my ears,” and that he kept coming to class “because it feels good.” And isn’t that the truth? It does feel good, on many levels. The point is, many of us come to yoga because of something physical, because we are seeking relief—and we stay for much more than that.

	 	  		A water footprint is an indicator that looks at both the direct and indirect water use of an individual, business, community, city or country.

Direct water use refers to the water we see coming out of the tap: the fresh water we use each day for drinking, cooking, showering, washing dishes and clothes, and gardening etc.

Indirect water use refers to the water that is used to manufacture the goods that we consume or produce, and the services that we use, as well as all of the water that is made unusable by pollution or wasted by non-use. That includes all of the water used to grow the food that we eat eat, to produce the things we use in daily life - clothes, books and furniture - and the water needed to produce the energy we use.

While this indirect water is "invisible", we often use far more of it than we realise.

In Europe, for example, the average person directly consumes between 100-150 litres of water a day - as drinking water, for washing clothes, bathing and watering plants.

But each person also indirectly consumes anywhere between 1,500 and 10,000 litres of per day, depending on where they live and their consumption habits.

Measuring water footprints can give us a clear picture of how water is used in today's society, and help us come up with strategies for more sustainable water usage.

Small and marginal farmers play an essential role in driving forward India’s economy and growth. Despite cultivating nearly 85% of the viable land in the country, these farmers are disproportionately vulnerable to the effects of climate change, market shifts, and other production risks. Too often these farmers fall through the cracks unable to access the services they need to increase their incomes and prosper.

	 	  		It's a tough time to defend religion. Respect for it has diminished in almost every corner of modern life — not just among atheists and intellectuals, but among the wider public, too. And the next generation of young people looks likely to be the most religiously unaffiliated demographic in recent memory.
     <br>
There are good reasons for this discontent: continued revelations of abuse by priests and clerics, jihad campaigns against “infidels” and homegrown Christian hostility toward diversity and secular culture. This convergence of bad behavior and bad press has led many to echo the evolutionary biologist E. O. Wilson’s claim that “for the sake of human progress, the best thing we could possibly do would be to diminish, to the point of eliminating, religious faiths.”
<br>
Despite the very real problems with religion — and my own historical skepticism toward it — We don’t subscribe to that view. We would like to argue here, in fact, that we still need religion.We are here to show the real beauties of religion, it's honest and true teachings.

	 	  		India was home to many invasions and thus it only added to the present variety. Today, India stands as a powerful and multi-cultured society as it has absorbed many cultures and moved on. People here have followed various religion, traditions, and customs.
<br>
Although people are turning modern today, hold on to the moral values and celebrates the festivals according to customs. So, we are still living and learning epic lessons from Ramayana and Mahabharata.

	 	  		In order to preserve the world, we need to focus on the conservation of the flora and fauna of the world. With the loss of trees and by deforestation, there has been an immense loss of natural habitat of the wild animals. Many of the species are standing on the verge of being extinct. Poaching and hunting of the wild animals have also led to the destruction. Hence, we need to understand the need of the hour to preserve wildlife and act accordingly. In order to conserve them, several steps can be taken both by the government and by the people of the world. Wildlife prevention and conservation acts should be implemented strictly by the government. People should stop using the materials made by wild animals. This would decrease their hunting. Environmental education should be a compulsory subject to be taught in the schools and the colleges to make the upcoming generation very well unknown with the fact.

	 	  		Art conservation and restoration, any attempt to conserve and repair architecture, paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, and objects of the decorative arts (furniture, glassware, metalware, textiles, ceramics, and so on) that have been adversely affected by negligence, willful damage, or, more usually, the inevitable decay caused by the effects of time and human use on the materials of which they are made.
	 	  		<br>
	 	  		The methods of art restoration used in earlier periods were closely linked to and limited by the art production techniques known at the time. Advances in science and technology and the development of conservation as a profession in the 20th century have led to safer and more effective approaches to studying, preserving, and repairing objects. Modern conservation practice adheres to the principle of reversibility, which dictates that treatments should not cause permanent alteration to the object. Art conservation has become an important tool of research; it is standard practice among professional conservators to document treatments with photographs and written reports.

	 	  		Assam's silk fabrics have earned immense recognition from all over the world. The state is home to several types of silks, the most prominent and prestigious being muga, the golden silk exclusive to this state. Muga apart, there is paat, and eri, the latter being used in the manufacture of warm clothes.
Of a naturally rich golden colour, muga is the finest of India's wild silks. It is produced only in Assam. The women of Assam weave fairy tales in their looms. In earlier times, the skill to weave was the primary qualification of a young girl for her eligibility for marriage. This perhaps explains why Assam has the largest concentration of handlooms and weavers in India. One of the world's finest artistic traditions finds expression in their exquisitely woven 'Eri', 'Muga' and 'Pat' fabrics.
<br>
The traditional handloom silks still hold their own in world markets They score over factory-made silks in the richness of their textures and designs, in their individuality, character and classic beauty. No two handwoven silks are exactly alike. Personality of the weaver, her hereditary skill, her innate sense of colour and balance all help to create a unique product.
<br>
Today, India exports a wide variety of silks to western Europe and the United States, especially as exclusive furnishing fabrics. Boutiques and fashion houses, designers and interior decorators have the advantage of getting custom-woven fabrics in the designs, weaves and colours of their choice. A service that ensures an exclusive product not easily copied by competitors.
 <br>
Weaving in Assam is so replete with artistic sensibility and so intimately linked to folk life that Gandhiji, during his famous tour to promote khadi and swadeshi, was so moved that he remarked: "Assamese women weave fairy tales in their clothes!"
 <br>
Almost as precious as Assam’s exotic silks – eri, muga and paat – are delicate tribal weaves such as Mirijim on blankets, mattresses and floor coverings (of Majuli and north-eastern Assam), shawls of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao district, Lasingphee blankets of bamboo and cotton in southern Assam’s Cachar district.
<br>
The expertise of Bodo and Rabha women too are evident in their distinctive motifs and colour schemes.
